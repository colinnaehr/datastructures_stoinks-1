It uses formulas on total volume and RSI to accomplish this. Libraries used: Java 11, JavaFX 11, and GSON. Entry pint class: HelloWorld.java (located at src/frontend/HelloWorld.java

To use: Fetch data first. Select one option from the data methods. The first element in the bottom toggle button corresponds to the total volume method. The second element after the slash in the bottom toggle button corresponds to RSI for date. There are two possible pairs. Total volume uses heapSort or mergesort, and RSI uses Hashmap or red and black tree map. For RSI, a date input is necessary.
